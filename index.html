            What drives me most is the process of turning complexity into
            clarity whether that means debugging a system, uncovering insights
            in messy data or improving the user experience through careful
            testing and design. I'm always looking for opportunities to learn,
            build and make technology work better for people.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    A full-stack web application for creating, browsing and
                    managing character builds for a competitive video game. I
                    designed and developed the entire platform independently,
                    covering both frontend and backend responsibilities.
                    <br /><br />

                    The frontend is built with
                    <strong>React and TypeScript</strong>, featuring dynamic
                    routing for gods, items and build detail pages, responsive
                    layouts and reusable UI components. <br /><br />

                    On the backend, I implemented a
                    <strong>PostgreSQL</strong> database with normalized
                    relational schemas and built services to ingest and
                    synchronize data from an external wiki API. The application
                    includes <strong>admin-only functionality</strong>
                    for creating and managing builds.

                  <p class="card-text">
                    This project analyzes the current state of the data analyst
                    job market in Hungary by scraping, cleaning and analyzing
                    over 100 job postings from profession.hu. The goal was to
                    identify the most in-demand skills, experience requirements
                    and geographic trends to help aspiring data analysts make
                    informed career decisions.<br /><br />
                    Using <strong>Python</strong> and
                    <strong>BeautifulSoup</strong>, I built a custom web scraper
                    that collected job listings and their full descriptions
                    across multiple search terms, handling deduplication and
                    data quality automatically. The data was then analyzed with
                    <strong>pandas</strong> to extract technical skills,
                    experience levels and location patterns.<br /><br />
                    Key findings include SQL and Python as the most demanded
                    skills in the Hungarian market, Power BI dominating as the
                    BI tool of choice and Budapest accounting for 40% of all
                    data analyst positions. Visualizations were created using
                    <strong>matplotlib</strong> and <strong>seaborn</strong>,
                    including a skill co-occurrence heatmap showing which skills
                    employers expect together.

                    Key findings include Beer accounting for 70% of total sales,

                  <p class="card-text">
                    I created a comprehensive
                    <strong>manual testing portfolio</strong> to demonstrate
                    professional QA skills through systematic bug
                    identification, documentation and root cause analysis. Using
                    the <strong>Academy Bugs</strong> practice platform, I
                    identified and documented <strong>8 bugs</strong> across
                    multiple categories including critical crash bugs, financial
                    calculation errors, functional issues and visual/UI
                    problems.<br /><br />

                    Each bug was professionally documented in
                    <strong>Jira</strong> with detailed reproduction steps,
                    severity/priority classifications and technical root cause
                    analysis using <strong>Chrome DevTools</strong>. I inspected
                    HTML/CSS structures, debugged JavaScript event handlers,
                    analyzed network requests and identified issues ranging from
                    invisible DOM overlays causing page freezes to a critical
                    $100 cart calculation error.<br /><br />

                    The portfolio demonstrates proficiency with
                    industry-standard QA tools (<strong>Jira, Confluence</strong
                    >), strong debugging capabilities and the ability to
                    communicate technical findings clearly. All bugs were
                    tracked through a complete Kanban workflow (To Do → In
                    Progress → In Review → Done) showcasing real-world bug
                    lifecycle management.

                    I built this portfolio website from scratch using
                    <strong>HTML, CSS, and JavaScript</strong> to showcase my
                    projects, skills and certifications in a clean, responsive
                    design. My goal was to create a simple but professional site
                    that reflects both my technical skills and attention to
                    detail. The website uses <strong>Bootstrap</strong> for
                    layout, <strong>Font Awesome</strong> for icons and includes
                    features like <em>dark mode</em> toggling, smooth animations
                    and responsive design for mobile and desktop. I also
                    implemented accessibility-friendly structure and clean code
                    organization for maintainability. Hosting it on
                    <strong>GitHub Pages</strong> taught me how to manage
                    version control, deploy updates seamlessly and think about
                    the user experience from both a developer and visitor
                    perspective. This project is a personal reflection of my
                    journey as a developer - combining design, functionality and
                    storytelling in one place.

                    menus collected between 1840 and 2015. I was curious to see
                    how food culture evolved over time but before analyzing
                    anything, the data needed serious cleaning. Using
                    <strong>SQL (PostgreSQL)</strong>, I handled missing values,
                    fixed inconsistent date formats, standardized text fields
                    and converted currency symbols into ISO codes to make the
                    dataset reliable and ready for analysis.<br /><br />
                    After cleaning, I built an interactive dashboard in
                    <strong>Power BI</strong> that visualizes how menus changed
                    over time with clear spikes in the early 1900s. It also
                    highlights the most common occasions like daily, anniversary
                    and complimentary events and shows how different venue types
                    (commercial, social and government) contributed to the data.
                    A custom date filter and summary cards make it easy to
                    explore specific periods and discover new insights.<br /><br />
                    This project was a great reminder of how much value comes
                    from cleaning and structuring data, the foundation for any
                    meaningful analysis or storytelling.

                    This project gave me hands-on experience in the world of
                    cybersecurity and network defense. Using
                    <strong>Wireshark</strong> I analyzed real network traffic
                    to understand how data moves across systems and how
                    potential threats can be detected through careful
                    observation. As part of the
                    <strong>Cisco CyberOps Associate</strong> course, I learned
                    how to monitor, identify and respond to suspicious activity
                    in a structured and analytical way. The project helped me
                    develop a stronger understanding of how security operations
                    centers (SOCs) function and how incident response teams use
                    evidence-based approaches to protect systems and users from
                    attacks. It was a great opportunity to combine technical
                    tools with critical thinking to build a foundation in
                    cybersecurity practices.
